This was a pretty simple introduction, all things considered. I had some initial trouble while using `bundle exec jekyll serve` (I don't know if that's the proper way to notate that), where it said I didn't have a specific file.

I slept on it, was planning on sending Dr. Goadrich an email the next day, when I ended up forgetting where I was in the instructions, and reentering `bundle install`, which checked and saw that I already had everything, didn't reinstall anything, luckily, and then installed like 3 new things?

One of them was the file that it said was missing, so I guess that got missed somehow ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

I then finished everything else in this lab, and here we are.

I think for the most part everything makes sense. I'm still not fully comfortable with jekyll and markdown, but that'll be easy enough to figure out I think, everything else has. I don't know how the layout of this works, but that should be resolved in the next lab if I change the theme, if I understand the basic idea there. I'd like to put a comment section in, that seems the most useful thing right now, but we'll see how complicated (or not complicated) it turns out to be. Could be a single line, could be having to run a second server just for this, somehow.

Here is a link to a github repository for a [discord music bot][music-bot], because youtube is cracking down on the commonly used ones so someone might have a use for this, it uses javascript, which is neat.

This is a link to an entirely browser based photo editing [website][website] that people like me who cannot afford photoshop may enjoy.

I am considering getting a dog, and these are the options I'm considering at the moment
* beagle (my grandparents had one and I loved him)
* some kind of spitz (I'm thinking Japanese)
* schipperke (can't pronounce it, but I love the mane)
* shiba inu (they just look nice and happy)
* jadgterrier (a really fun and unpronounceable name, but also the first picture I saw of one just looks amazing)

I don't think I'll actually get one since I'm living on campus, but it is something I would like to do at some point.
