Honestly, the whole thing was not very difficult. The most confusing parts were when it referred to specific files that I could not find immediately, or when it referred to things that were on my screen, but were only a single line without the context of what was around it. Beyond that, adding a search bar was a bit difficult for when I was making my own RazorPage, but that was mainly due to having to type up the code but with my own terms rather than movies, and missing a capitalization or the like once or twice. I can see a number of similarities between Jekyll and Razor, but there are more differences than similarities: in terms of similarities, they are both similar in terms of a lot of work can be done to end up with something you can edit relatively easily, and additionally, I can look at each piece of Jekyll or Razor and get an understanding of why it is there and what purpose it serves, which I appreciate, but beyond that, the actual steps going into doing that work can be very different. I think Jekyll is more immediately understandable by the end, since it is simply markdown at that point, but Razor has more uses and more complexity.
